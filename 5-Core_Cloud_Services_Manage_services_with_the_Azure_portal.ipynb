    "\n",
    "## Azure management options\n",
    "You can configure and manage Azure using a broad range of tools and platforms. Tools that are commonly used for day-to-day management and interaction include:\n",
    "- Azure portal for interacting with Azure via a Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n",
    "- Azure PowerShell and Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) for command line and automation-based interactions with Azure\n",

    "\n",
    "### Azure PowerShell\n",
    "Azure PowerShell is a module that you can install for Windows PowerShell, or PowerShell Core, which is a cross-platform version of PowerShell that runs on Windows, Linux or macOS. Azure PowerShell enables you to connect to your Azure subscription and manage resources. Azure PowerShell then adds the Azure-specific commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Azure PowerShell: create a VM\n",
    "For example, Azure PowerShell provides the New-AzureRmVM command that creates a virtual machine for you inside your Azure subscription. To use it, you would launch PowerShell, install the Azure PowerShell module, sign in to your Azure account using the command Connect-AzureRMAccount, and then issue a command such as:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "New-AzureRmVm `\n",
    "    -ResourceGroupName \"MyResourceGroup\" `\n",
    "    -Name \"TestVm\" `\n",
    "    -Image \"UbuntuLTS\"\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure CLI\n",
    "Azure CLI is a cross-platform command-line program that connects to Azure and executes administrative commands on Azure resources. Cross-platform means that it can be run on Windows, Linux, or macOS. For example, to create a VM, you would open a command prompt window, sign in to Azure using the command az login, create a resource group, then use a command such as:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "az vm create \\\n",
    "  --resource-group MyResourceGroup \\\n",
    "  --name TestVm \\\n",
    "  --image UbuntuLTS\n",
    "  --generate-ssh-keys\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure Cloud Shell\n",
    "Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based scripting environment for command-line administration of Azure resources. It provides support for two shell environments. Linux users can opt for a Bash experience, while Windows users can use PowerShell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure Mobile App\n",
    "The Microsoft Azure mobile app allows you to access, manage, and monitor all your Azure accounts and resources from your iOS or Android phone or tablet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Access public and private preview features\n",
    "Microsoft offer previews of Azure features for evaluation purposes. With Azure Preview Features, you can test beta and other pre-release features, products, services, software, and regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common areas you will see previews for include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- New storage types\n",
    "- New Azure services, such as Machine Learning enhancements\n",
    "- New or enhanced integration with other platforms\n",
    "- New APIs for services\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a feature has been evaluated and tested successfully, it might be released to customers as part of Azure's default product set. This release is referred to as __General Availability__ (GA).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature preview categories\n",
    "There are two types of previews available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Private Preview__: This means that an Azure feature is available to * specific* Azure customers for evaluation purposes. This is typically by invite only and issued directly by the product team responsible for the feature or service.\n",
    "- __Public Preview__: This means that an Azure feature is available to all Azure customers for evaluation purposes. These previews can be turned on through the preview features page as detailed below."
