    "# Create an Azure Account\n",
    "\n",
    "With a free Azure account and subscription, you can build, test, and deploy enterprise applications, create custom web and mobile experiences, and gain insights from your data through machine learning and powerful analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main Azure subscriptions are: free, pay-as-you-go, Enterprise agreement and student.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create multiple subscriptions under a single Azure account. This is particularly useful for businesses because access control and billing occur at the subscription level, not the account level.\n",
    "\n",
    "One bill is generated for every Azure subscription on a monthly basis. The payment is charged automatically to the associated account credit or debit card within 10 days after the billing period ends. You can analyze your bill in the Azure portal - this will provide access to all your invoices, as well as a cost analysis breakdown of what got charged each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication for your account is performed using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Azure AD is a modern identity provider that supports multiple authentication protocols to secure applications and services in the cloud."
