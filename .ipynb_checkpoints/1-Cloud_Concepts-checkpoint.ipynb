    "# Cloud Concepts - Principles of cloud computing\n",
    "## What is cloud computing?\n",
    "Cloud computing is renting ressources, like storage space or CPU cycles, on another company's computers. The company providing these services is called the __cloud provider__. The offered computing services typically include: compute power, storage, networking and analytics (the first two being the two most common services).\n",
    "### Compute power\n",
    "Based on the resources and needs you have, there are different altertanives you can choose.\n",
    "#### Virtual Machines\n",
    "A VM is an emulation of a computer. It includes an operating system and hardware on which you can install the softwares you need and start computing in the cloud. The VM runs on a physical server in one of the provider's datacenters.\n",
    "#### Containers\n",
    "Containers provide a consistent, isolated execution environment for applications. They are similar to VMs except they don't require a guest operating system. Instead, the application and all its dependencies is packaged into a \"container\" and then a standard runtime environment is used to execute the app. This allows the container to start up in just a few seconds because there's no OS to boot and initialize. You only need the app to launch.<br>\n",
    "Docker is the leading open-source platform for managing containers. Docker containers allow different component sof the application to be deployed independently into different containers. Multiple containers can be run on a single machine, and containers can be moved between machines. The portability of the container makes it easy for applications to be deployed in multiple environments.\n",
    "#### Serverless computing\n",
    "Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating, configuring, or maintaining a server. The core idea is that your application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered by some action. This is ideal for automated tasks - for example, you can build a serverless process that automatically sends an email confirmation after a customer makes an online purchase. <br><br>\n",
    "Here is a recap of the three computer power services.\n",
    "<img src=\"Files/vm-vs-container-vs-serverless.png\">\n",
    "## Benefits of cloud computing\n",
    "### It's cost-effective\n",
    "Cloud computing provides a __pay-as-you-go__ or __consumption-based__ pricing model.\n",
    "### It's scalable\n",
    "You can increase or decrease the resources and services used based on the demand or workload at any given time. Cloud computing supports both vertical and horizontal scaling depending on your needs. <br>\n",
    "__Vertical scaling__, also known as \"scaling up\", is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. Some examples of vertical scaling are: adding more CPUs, or adding more memory. <br>\n",
    "__Horizontal scaling__, also known as \"scaling out\", is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit.\n",
    "### It's elastic\n",
    "As your workload changes due to a spike or drop in demand, a cloud computing system can compensate by automatically adding or removing resources.\n",
    "## Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)\n",
    "### Capital Expenditure (CapEx) \n",
    "CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time. <br>\n",
    "A typical on-premises data center includes costs such as servec costs, storage costs, network costs, backup and archive costs, datacenter infrasture costs and technical personnel costs.\n",
    "### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)\n",
    "OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There's no upfront cost. You pay for a service or product as you use it. <br>\n",
    "With cloud computing, many of the costs associated with an on-premises datacenter are shifted to the service provider. Costs covered by the provider are: leasing a cloud-based server, leasing software and customized features, scaling charges.\n",
    "### Benefits of CapEx\n",
    "With capital expenditures, you plan your expenses at the start of a project or budget period. Your costs are fixed, meaning you know exactly how much is being spent. This is appealing when you need to predict the expenses before a project starts due to a limited budget.\n",
    "### Benefits of OpEx\n",
    "Demand and growth can be unpredictable and can outpace expectation, which is a challenge for the CapEx model. With the OpEx model, companies wanting to try a new product or service don't need to invest in equipment. Instead, they pay as much or as little for the infrastructure as required.\n",
    "## Cloud deployment models\n",
    "There are three different cloud deployment models: public, private and hybrid. A cloud deployment model defines where your data is stored and how your customers interact with it.\n",
    "### Public cloud\n",
    "This is the most common deployment model. In this case, you have no local hardware to manage or keep up-to-date – everything runs on your cloud provider’s hardware. <br>\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- High scalability/agility - no need to buy a new server in order to scale\n",
    "- Pay-as-you-go pricing – you pay only for what you use, no CapEx costs\n",
    "- You’re not responsible for maintenance or updates of the hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- There may be specific security requirements that cannot be met by using public cloud\n",
    "- You don't own the hardware or services and cannot manage them as you may want to\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private cloud\n",
    "In a private cloud, you create a cloud environment in your own datacenter and provide self-service access to compute resources to users in your organization. This offers a simulation of a public cloud to your users, but you remain completely responsible for the purchase and maintenance of the hardware and software services you provide.\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- You have complete control over the resources and can ensure the configuration can support any scenario or legacy application\n",
    "- You have complete control (and responsibility) over security\n",
    "- Private clouds can meet strict security, compliance, or legal requirements in ways a public cloud might not be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- You have upfront CapEx costs and must purchase the hardware for startup and maintenance\n",
    "- Owning the equipment limits the agility - to scale you must buy, install, and setup new hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid cloud\n",
    "A hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, allowing you to run your applications in the most appropriate location. For example, you could host a website in the public cloud and link it to a highly secure database hosted in your private cloud (or on-premises datacenter).\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- You can keep any systems running and accessible that use out-of-date hardware or an out-of-date operating system\n",
    "- You have flexibility with what you run locally versus in the cloud\n",
    "- You can take advantage of economies of scale from public cloud providers for services and resources where it's cheaper, and then supplement with your own equipment when it's not\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- It can be more expensive than selecting one deployment model since it involves some CapEx cost up front\n",
    "- It can be more complicated to set up and manage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of cloud services\n",
    "There are three different categories of services: Iaas, PaaS and SaaS.\n",
    "### Infrastructure as a service\n",
    "Infrastructure as a Service is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs your application (IT infrastructure servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems). Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it. It's an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.\n",
    "### Platform as a service\n",
    "PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you create an application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure. For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, you don't have to install an operating system, web server, or even system updates.\n",
    "### Software as a service\n",
    "SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer. It is usually based on an architecture where one version of the application is used for all customers, and licensed through a monthly or annual subscription. Office 365, Skype, and Dynamics CRM Online are perfect examples of SaaS software.\n",
    "### Management resposabilities\n",
    "The following illustration shows a list of resources that you manage and that your service provider manages in each cloud service category.\n",
    "<img src=\"Files/5-layer-diagram.png\">\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- IaaS requires the most user management of all the cloud services. The user is responsible for managing the operating systems, data, and applications.\n",
    "- PaaS requires less user management. The cloud provider manages the operating systems, and the user is responsible for the applications and data they run and store.\n",
    "- SaaS requires the least amount of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the software."
